/**
 * Execution Layer (Layer 5)
 *
 * Pure capability execution with token-based authorization.
 * Implements Constitutional separation from governance.
 *
 * Components:
 * - ToolRegistry: Capability catalog (what tools exist)
 * - ToolExecutor: Execution engine (runs authorized tools)
 *
 * This layer:
 * - Cannot make permission decisions (PolicyEngine does that)
 * - Cannot bypass token verification
 * - Enforces timeouts and sandboxing
 * - Reports execution results
