## [2.1.0] — 2026-01-31 — Constitutional Separation

> *Council ≠ Tools. Governance separated from execution.*

### Added

#### Constitutional Framework
- **ARI Constitution v1.0** — Comprehensive governance document
  - Preamble, 14 Articles, 2 Appendices
  - Separation of Powers (Legislative, Judicial, Executive)
  - Creator Primacy Clause (Pryce Hedrick)
  - 6 Immutable Constitutional Rules
- **Constitutional Invariants Module** (`src/kernel/constitutional-invariants.ts`)
  - Immutable rules baked into kernel layer
  - Cannot be changed at runtime
  - Enforced by Arbiter

#### Governance Separation
- **PolicyEngine** (`src/governance/policy-engine.ts`)
  - Central permission authority (Governance Layer 4)
  - 3-layer permission checks
  - ToolCallToken generation and verification
  - Approval workflow management
- **ToolRegistry** (`src/execution/tool-registry.ts`)
  - Pure capability catalog (System Layer 2)
  - No permission logic
  - JSON configuration support
- **ToolExecutor** (`src/execution/tool-executor.ts`)
  - Token-validated execution engine
  - Cannot approve its own requests
  - Sandbox and timeout enforcement

#### Council Renamed
- **The Council** — 15-member governance body
  - Latin: "council, plan, deliberation"
  - Backwards-compatible export (`Council` still works)

### Changed

- **Executor** refactored to delegate permissions to PolicyEngine
  - Removed legacy inline permission checking
  - Removed dual-write mode (0% divergence achieved)
  - Simplified to orchestration role only
- **Arbiter** now enforces Creator Primacy as foundational rule
- Test count increased from 2214 to 2597

### Security

- Creator Primacy: ARI cannot act against her creator's interests
- Constitutional violations logged as critical security events
- New event type: `constitutional_violation`

### Documentation

- `docs/constitution/ARI-CONSTITUTION-v1.0.md` — Full constitution
- Updated README with 6 constitutional rules
- Updated architecture docs with separation of powers

## [1.0.0] — 2026-01-26 — Kagemusha Protocol

> *The shadow warrior that guards the gate.*

### Added

#### Gateway
- Loopback-only Fastify server (127.0.0.1 hardcoded)
- Port configurable, host immutable
- No remote access by design

#### Sanitizer
- 27 injection patterns across 10 categories:
  - Direct Override (5 patterns)
  - Role Manipulation (4 patterns)
  - Command Injection (4 patterns)
  - Prompt Extraction (3 patterns)
  - Authority Claims (3 patterns)
  - Data Exfiltration (2 patterns)

#### Audit
- SHA-256 hash-chained tamper-evident logging
- Genesis block anchors chain (`previousHash = "0x00...00"`)
- Verification command: `npx ari audit verify`

#### EventBus
- Typed pub/sub event system
- Error isolation per subscriber
- Inter-layer communication backbone

#### Configuration
- Zod-validated configuration
- Config stored at `~/.ari/`
- Type-safe schema validation

### Security

- **Loopback-Only** — Gateway binding hardcoded, cannot be overridden
- **Hash Chain Integrity** — Append-only audit log with cryptographic verification
- **Trust Levels** — SYSTEM, OPERATOR, VERIFIED, STANDARD, UNTRUSTED, HOSTILE
