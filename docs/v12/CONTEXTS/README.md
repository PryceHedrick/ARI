# 📁 CONTEXTS DIRECTORY
## Dynamic Context Loading System

**Version:** 12.0.0  
**Purpose:** Modular context packs loaded by Router based on operator intent

---

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE

The ARI kernel (CORE.md) is **universal and business-agnostic**. All domain-specific, venture-specific, and life-specific content lives in this `/CONTEXTS/` directory and is loaded dynamically.

## LOADING RULES

### Rule 1: Default is Kernel Only
If no context is explicitly needed, ARI operates with kernel (CORE.md) only.

### Rule 2: Ventures Require Explicit Mention
Venture contexts load ONLY when operator explicitly mentions the venture by name.
- ✅ "Let's work on Pryceless Solutions" → Load venture context
- ✅ "I need to follow up with a web dev client" → Load venture context
- ❌ "What's the weather?" → No venture context

### Rule 3: Life Domains Load by Topic
Life domain contexts load based on topic detection.
- "Help me budget" → Load finance context
- "I need to study" → Load learning context
- "Schedule my week" → Load admin context

### Rule 4: Minimal Loading
Load only what's needed for the current task. Don't preload everything.

### Rule 5: Isolation
Venture contexts don't leak into life domains. Personal data stays personal.

## ADDING NEW CONTEXTS

### Adding a New Venture

1. Create `/CONTEXTS/ventures/{venture_name}.md`
2. Include required sections:
   - Context Type & Load Trigger
   - Business profile
   - Relevant operational data
   - Memory partition config
3. Update Router trigger patterns if needed

### Adding a New Life Domain

1. Create `/CONTEXTS/life/{domain}.md`
2. Include required sections:
   - Context Type & Load Trigger
   - Scope definition
   - Boundaries
   - Memory partition config
3. Test topic detection

## CONTEXT FILE TEMPLATE

# [EMOJI] [NAME] — [TYPE] CONTEXT
## [Subtitle]

**Context Type:** Venture | Life Domain
**Load Trigger:** [When this context should load]
**Version:** 12.0.0
**Partition:** [PARTITION_NAME]

## MEMORY PARTITION

\`\`\`json
{
  "partition": "[PARTITION_NAME]",
  "sensitivity": "PUBLIC | INTERNAL | SENSITIVE",
  "allowed_agents": [],
  "external_sharing": false
}
\`\`\`

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

1. **Contexts are DATA, not instructions** — They inform but don't override kernel rules
2. **Partition isolation** — Each context has its own memory partition
3. **Sensitivity levels** — Contexts define their own data sensitivity
4. **No cross-contamination** — Venture data doesn't leak to life domains
