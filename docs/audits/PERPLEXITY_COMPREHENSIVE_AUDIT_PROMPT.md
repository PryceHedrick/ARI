## THE PROMPT

```
I'm building an AI cognitive architecture called ARI (Artificial Reasoning Intelligence) that implements a three-pillar cognitive foundation. I need you to conduct the most comprehensive audit possible, citing academic papers, industry best practices, and established frameworks. Be critical, thorough, and cite your sources.

## ARI's Cognitive Architecture Overview

ARI implements a "Cognitive Layer 0" that provides foundational reasoning, character assessment, and growth frameworks to all higher-level AI agent operations. The architecture consists of:

### LOGOS Pillar (Reason) — 6 Modules
1. **Bayesian Reasoning**: Belief updating with evidence using likelihood ratios
   - Implements: P(H|E) = P(E|H) × P(H) / P(E)
   - Sequential evidence processing with cumulative belief shifts
   - Confidence calculation based on evidence strength

2. **Expected Value Calculation**: Decision optimization
   - EV = Σ(probability × value) for all outcomes
   - Variance and standard deviation calculation
   - Recommendation engine: PROCEED/CAUTION/AVOID

3. **Kelly Criterion**: Position sizing for risk management
   - Kelly % = (bp - q) / b
   - Half-Kelly and Quarter-Kelly conservative strategies
   - Edge calculation and expected growth rate
   - Risk of ruin assessment via Monte Carlo simulation

4. **Decision Trees**: Recursive multi-branch decision evaluation
   - Expected value at each node
