Risk: Zero (not in production)
Recovery: Debug and test locally
```

**Scenario 2: Deployment Issues (Phase 5)**

```
Action: Immediate rollback
Steps:
1. Stop daemon on Mac Mini
2. Revert to previous commit
3. Rebuild and restart
4. Verify stable operation
Recovery time: 10 minutes
```

**Scenario 3: Production Issues (After Deployment)**

```
Action: Disable autonomous mode
Steps:
1. ssh ari@100.81.73.34 "npx ari daemon stop"
2. Investigate root cause
3. Fix and test locally
4. Re-deploy when confident
Recovery time: Hours to days (depending on issue)
```

**Worst Case: Complete Rollback**

```
1. Stop daemon
2. Restore .ari directory from backup
3. Checkout previous stable commit
4. Rebuild and restart
5. Back to current state (idle but stable)
Time: 30 minutes
```
