## Time Savings Analysis

### Manual vs Autonomous Work Comparison

**Daily Test Writing:**
```
Manual Approach:
├─ Identify files needing tests: 15 min
├─ Write 2 test files: 60 min
├─ Run and debug: 20 min
├─ Commit: 5 min
└─ TOTAL: 100 minutes/day

ARI Autonomous:
├─ Identifies files: automatic
├─ Generates tests in worktree: automatic
├─ Runs and validates: automatic
├─ You review summary: 5 min
└─ TOTAL: 5 minutes/day

Time Saved: 95 minutes/day
```

**Documentation Updates:**
```
Manual:
├─ Notice docs are stale: 10 min
├─ Update README, CHANGELOG: 30 min
├─ Review and commit: 10 min
└─ TOTAL: 50 minutes every few days = ~15 min/day avg

ARI Autonomous:
├─ Detects stale docs: automatic
├─ Updates docs: automatic
├─ You review diff: 3 min
└─ TOTAL: 3 minutes/day

Time Saved: 12 minutes/day
```

**Morning Planning:**
```
Manual:
├─ Review what happened yesterday: 10 min
├─ Check git status, PRs, issues: 10 min
├─ Prioritize today's work: 15 min
└─ TOTAL: 35 minutes/morning

ARI Autonomous:
├─ Brief generated overnight: automatic
├─ Read brief (already prioritized): 3 min
└─ TOTAL: 3 minutes/morning

Time Saved: 32 minutes/day
```

**Total Daily Time Savings:**
```
Test writing: 95 min
Documentation: 12 min
Morning planning: 32 min
TODO resolution: 20 min
Code quality checks: 15 min
───────────────────────
TOTAL: ~174 minutes/day = 2.9 hours/day

Monthly: ~87 hours saved
Yearly: ~1,044 hours saved (26 work-weeks!)
```

**Value Calculation (Conservative):**
```
If your time is worth $50/hour:
├─ Daily value: 2.9 hours × $50 = $145/day
├─ Monthly value: ~$4,350/month
└─ Cost: $75/month

ROI: 58x ($4,350 value / $75 cost)
```

## Comparison: Without vs With Intelligent Routing

### Without Model Routing (Naive Approach)

**Scenario:** Use Sonnet for everything

```
Daily Autonomous Tasks (20 tasks):
├─ Every task uses Sonnet
├─ Average tokens per task: 15,000
├─ Total tokens: 300,000/day
├─ Cost at Sonnet rates: ~$1.20/day
└─ Monthly: ~$36/month

Scheduled Tasks (15 tasks):
├─ Every task uses Sonnet
├─ Total tokens: 200,000/day
├─ Cost at Sonnet rates: ~$0.80/day
└─ Monthly: ~$24/month

TOTAL: ~$60/month for autonomous work alone
Problem: Uses expensive model for simple tasks
```

### With Intelligent Routing

**Scenario:** Route based on complexity

```
Daily Autonomous Tasks (20 tasks):
├─ 14 tasks use Haiku (70%): 70k tokens @ $0.049
├─ 5 tasks use Sonnet (25%): 75k tokens @ $0.30
├─ 1 task uses Opus (5%): 20k tokens @ $0.38
└─ Total: 165k tokens, ~$0.73/day, ~$22/month

Scheduled Tasks (15 tasks):
├─ 10 tasks use Haiku (67%): 40k tokens @ $0.028
├─ 5 tasks use Sonnet (33%): 125k tokens @ $0.50
└─ Total: 165k tokens, ~$0.53/day, ~$16/month

TOTAL: ~$38/month for autonomous work
Savings: $22/month (37% reduction)
```

**Key Insight:** Intelligent routing saves ~$264/year while maintaining quality where it matters.

- ✓ You want to minimize costs
- ✓ You're okay with limited autonomous work
- ✓ You'll still do most tasks manually
- ✓ Testing the concept first
- ✓ Budget is tight

- ✓ You want active autonomous capabilities
- ✓ You trust ARI to work independently
- ✓ You want continuous improvement
- ✓ **This is the recommended starting point**

### Choose Aggressive ($150/month) If:
- ✓ Cost is not a concern
- ✓ You want absolute maximum capability
- ✓ You value quality > cost
- ✓ You're building ARI as a product
- ✓ You want fastest learning curve

Net: -$3,750/month
```

### Option 2: ARI Autonomous (Balanced)

```
Monthly cost: $75
Time saved: 2.5 hours/day = $3,750 value
Net: +$3,675/month
ROI: 4,900% (49x return)
```

### Option 3: Hire Junior Dev for These Tasks

```
Junior dev: $40/hour × 2.5 hours/day × 22 days
Monthly cost: $2,200
Quality: Variable
Availability: Limited to work hours
Net: -$2,200/month
```

### Option 4: GitHub Copilot Workspace (Alternative AI)

```
Monthly cost: ~$20
Capabilities: Code generation only
Autonomous: No
Context persistence: No
Deliverables: No
Value: Limited to coding time

Cost: Same ($75)
Net ROI: 45x
```

**Realistic (80% success rate):**
```
Tasks attempted: 400/month
Tasks successful: 320/month
Tasks failed: 80/month

Value delivered: 80% of potential
Rework cost: +$10/month (fixing failures)
Total cost: $85/month
Net ROI: 35x (still excellent)
```

**Pessimistic (70% success rate):**
```
Tasks attempted: 400/month
Tasks successful: 280/month

4. Auto-execution (low-risk only)
5. Test generation (when needed)

**Monitor for 1 week:**
- Actual costs
- Task quality
- User satisfaction
- Time savings

**Then optimize:**

- Scale up/down as needed

**Expected outcome after 1 month:**
- $50-65/month actual cost
- 60+ autonomous tasks completed
- 2+ hours/day saved

## Conclusion

The 24/7 autonomous ARI system with intelligent cost management is:

✅ **Technically feasible** - All infrastructure exists or is well-defined  
✅ **Economically viable** - $75/month for $3,750/month value (50x ROI)  
✅ **Risk-managed** - Multiple safety gates and throttling mechanisms  
✅ **User-controlled** - Approval gates, emergency switches, full transparency  
✅ **Continuously improving** - Learning loops make it better over time

**The only thing missing:** Implementation.

**Next step:** Execute the implementation plan in `docs/plans/2026-02-03-24-7-autonomous-ari-with-cost-management.md`
