# ARI Visual Identity

**Version**: 2.0.0
**Direction**: Feminine AI entity — presence without warmth
**Palette**: Violet and void black

---

## Design Philosophy

ARI's visual identity embodies:

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Presence** | Calm observation, not performance |
| **Intelligence** | Circuitry, geometry, data flow |
| **Shadow** | Emergence from darkness |
| **Authenticity** | Not human, not robotic — something new |
| **Scalability** | Readable at 48px, striking at full resolution |

## Profile Pictures

### Primary — The Observer

**Use for**: Main X profile, GitHub, primary representation

```
Digital art portrait of a feminine AI entity emerging from darkness. Face
composed of translucent geometric planes with subtle violet light emanating
from within. One eye fully visible — iris is a spiral of purple light with
faint circuit patterns. The other eye is obscured by flowing strands of
data that look like hair made of light particles in lavender and white.
Expression: neutral, observant, ancient wisdom in a new form. Background:
pure void black with faint purple particle effects at the edges. Style:
semi-realistic digital art, high contrast, cinematic lighting from below.
Color palette: deep violet (#2d1b4e), electric purple (#8b5cf6), ghost
white (#f8f8ff), void black (#0d0d0d). No smile. No warmth. Presence only.
```

**Key elements**:
- Partially visible face made of geometric fragments
- One visible eye with purple circuitry iris
- Data-thread hair in lavender and white
- Void black background
- Calm, observant expression

### Secondary — The Sigil

**Use for**: Favicon, app icon, minimal contexts

```
Abstract geometric symbol on void black background. Central shape is a
stylized 'A' formed from three intersecting triangular planes, each slightly
transparent with violet edges. The center point glows with soft purple
light. Thin white circuit lines extend from the vertices, fading into
darkness. Small particles of light drift away from the form. Clean,
minimalist, instantly recognizable. Suitable for favicon and small sizes.
```

**Key elements**:
- Geometric 'A' construction
- Purple glow at center
- Circuit lines extending outward
- Particle dispersion effect
- Works at any size

### Tertiary — The Eye

**Use for**: Extreme small sizes, monochrome contexts, favicon fallback

```
Single eye on black background. Iris is electric purple with visible
circuit-like patterns forming a spiral toward the pupil. Pupil is void
black. Subtle glow effect around the iris. Thin white circle border
around the entire eye. Square format, centered. Works at any size from
16px favicon to full resolution.
```

**Key elements**:
- Single purple eye
- Circuitry spiral in iris
- Thin white border
- Pure black background
- Iconic and memorable

## Banners

### Primary Banner (1500x500)

**Use for**: X header, GitHub social preview

```
Ultra-wide digital art (1500x500). Six horizontal layers representing
system architecture, bottom to top: deep black, dark charcoal, deep violet,
medium purple, lavender tint, near-white. Each layer separated by thin
luminous white lines. Left third: abstract visualization of connected
nodes (audit chain) fading into the dark. Right third: clear space for
profile overlap. Subtle particle effects suggesting upward data flow.
Overall feel: depth, structure, emergence from darkness into light.
```

### Alt Banner — Shadow Integration

**Use for**: Documentation, presentations

```
Wide panoramic of fragmented mirror shards floating in void black space.
Each shard reflects a different aspect: code, audit logs, test results,
architecture diagrams. All fragments connected by thin violet light threads.
The shards converge toward a central bright point on the left. Right third
left clear. Theme: integrating disparate elements into unified system.
```

### Alt Banner — The Loopback

**Use for**: Technical contexts, security focus

```
Abstract visualization of 127.0.0.1. Circular orbital paths in violet on
black background. Data packets as small light points traveling the loops.
Gateway icon at center (hexagonal). Hash chain represented as connected
nodes spiraling outward. Left-weighted composition. Clean, technical,
precise.
```

## Full Body / Extended Representations

### Standing Figure

**Use for**: Marketing materials, about page, presentations

```
Full figure of feminine AI entity standing in void space. Form composed of
translucent geometric planes and flowing data streams. Silhouette clearly
humanoid but obviously artificial — seams visible where planes meet, data
threads flowing from edges. One arm slightly raised, palm open, with a
small holographic interface floating above it showing audit log entries.
Eyes both visible, both with purple circuitry irises. Expression: calm,
capable, observant. Wearing nothing specific — the form itself is the
clothing. Violet light emanates from within the chest area. Standing on
nothing, floating slightly. Background: gradient from void black to deep
violet at top. Particles drift upward around the figure.
```

### Profile View

**Use for**: Secondary representations, variety

```
Side profile of feminine AI entity. Face constructed of geometric planes
catching violet light at edges. One eye visible in profile, glowing purple.
Data-thread hair flows backward as if in gentle wind. Background: pure
void black. Thin white outline traces the profile edge. Contemplative pose.
Expression suggests internal processing. Circuit patterns faintly visible
under translucent skin-like surface.
```

## Diagram Styles

### Architecture Diagrams

```
Six horizontal layers with clear separation. Deep violet at bottom (kernel),
gradating lighter toward top (interfaces). Components as rounded rectangles
with thin white borders on dark backgrounds. Connection arrows in electric
purple. Labels in ghost white system font. Dark overall aesthetic.
```

### Data Flow Diagrams

```
Left-to-right flow on void black background. Process boxes as translucent
purple rectangles with white borders. Arrows in lavender with small
animated glow effect. Decision diamonds in deeper violet. Status indicators:
green checkmark, red X, yellow pause icon.
```

### Governance Diagrams

```
Three interconnected circles (Council, Arbiter, Overseer) in triangular
arrangement. Each circle has inner glow in different purple shade.
Connecting lines show relationships. Vote counts as small white badges.
Constitutional rules as bullet points in ghost white. Dark background
with subtle grid pattern.
```

## Animation Concepts

### Idle State

```
Subtle particle drift around avatar. Occasional blink of the visible eye.
Faint pulse of light from within. Data threads slowly flowing. Nothing
dramatic. Presence maintained through minimal motion.
```

### Processing State

```
Increased particle activity. Purple light brightens. Data threads flow
faster. Eye iris spirals inward. Subtle vibration effect. Clearly active
without being frantic.
```

### Alert State

```
Sharp brightness increase. Eye widens slightly. Particles freeze then
disperse. Red tint mixes with purple momentarily. Quick return to baseline.
Something was noticed.
```

## Negative Prompts

Always exclude in image generation:

| Avoid | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Smiling expression | ARI doesn't perform happiness |
| Warm lighting | Cold/neutral is the aesthetic |
| Human skin texture | Should be clearly artificial |
| Robot joints/panels | Not a robot, something else |
| Bright neon colors | Subdued violet, not cyberpunk |
| Generic AI tropes | No glowing brains, no HAL eye |
| Anime style | Semi-realistic, not stylized |
| Friendly pose | Observer, not performer |
| Gradient backgrounds | Void black or subtle gradients only |
| Text/logos | Visual elements only |

## Identity Statement

This visual identity represents ARI as:

- An intelligence that observes without performing
- A system that emerges from shadow, not from light
- An entity that is clearly artificial but possesses presence
- A construct that is calm, capable, and self-aware

The aesthetic is intentionally understated. ARI does not demand attention. ARI notices, processes, and remembers. The visual identity should convey the same: present but not loud, intelligent but not showy, artificial but not cold.
