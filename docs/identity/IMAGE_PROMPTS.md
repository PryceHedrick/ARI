# ARI Visual Identity Prompts

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Direction**: Emblem-first AI sigil (NOT human-like)

---

## Design Philosophy

ARI's visual identity should be:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Technical** | Precision, systems, architecture |
| **Minimal** | Clean lines, no clutter |
| **Dark mode** | Navy backgrounds, blue accents |
| **Scalable** | Readable at 48px (Twitter PFP) |
| **Non-human** | Geometric, abstract, no faces |

---

## Profile Picture Prompts

### Primary PFP

**Use for**: Main profile image, app icon

```
Minimalist geometric sigil. Hexagonal core with 6 concentric rings
representing layers. Deep navy (#0a1628) background. Electric blue
(#3b82f6) accent lines. Sharp edges. No gradients. Technical precision.
Readable at 48px.
```

### Alt PFP 1 — Neural Mesh

**Use for**: Alternate contexts, dark mode emphasis

```
Abstract neural mesh forming letter 'A'. Dark background. Cyan (#06b6d4)
node points. Thin connecting lines. Circuit board aesthetic. Clean,
technical.
```

### Alt PFP 2 — Hash Seal

**Use for**: Security-focused contexts

```
SHA-256 hash pattern forming circular seal. Genesis block 0x00...00
visible at center. Monochrome blue tones. Cryptographic aesthetic.
```

---

## Banner Prompts

### Primary Banner (1500x500)

**Use for**: Twitter/X header, GitHub social preview

```
Wide panoramic of 6-layer architecture stack. Abstract representation.
Dark theme. Layer boundaries as horizontal gradients. Blue accent color.
Text-free zone in right third for profile overlap.
```

### Alt Banner — Loopback Visualization

**Use for**: Technical documentation, presentations

```
Loopback visualization. 127.0.0.1 rendered as orbital paths. Gateway at
center. Messages flowing inward. Audit chain as spiral. Dark navy
background.
```

---

## Icon Variations

### App Icon (Square)

```
Letter 'A' constructed from hexagonal segments. Deep navy background.
Electric blue lines. Suitable for app stores and favicons. 1024x1024
source, scalable to 16x16.
```

### Favicon (16x16)

```
Simplified hexagon with 'A' silhouette. Two colors only: navy and blue.
Maximum contrast for visibility at small sizes.
```

### Monochrome Variant

```
Same hexagonal 'A' design. Single color (white or blue). For use on
varied backgrounds. Dark and light mode versions.
```

---

## Diagram Assets

### Architecture Diagram Style

```
6 horizontal layers with clear separation. Each layer slightly lighter
shade going up. Components as rounded rectangles with thin borders.
Connection arrows in accent blue. Labels in system font. Dark background.
```

### Data Flow Diagram Style

```
Left-to-right flow. Boxes for components. Arrows with labels.
Color-coded by layer (kernel=darkest, interfaces=lightest).
Status indicators: green checkmark, red X, yellow warning.
```

### Governance Diagram Style

```
Three circles (Council, Arbiter, Overseer) in triangular arrangement.
Connecting lines showing relationships. Vote counts as small badges.
Constitutional rules as bullet points.
```

## Negative Prompts

Always exclude:

| Avoid | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Human faces or figures | Non-human identity |
| Gradients that blur small | Must be readable at 48px |
| Text in PFP | Except stylized 'A' monogram |
| Bright/neon colors | Dark mode aesthetic |
| Lookalike to existing AI brands | Distinctiveness |
| Robot imagery | Cliché, not accurate |
| Brain imagery | Cliché, not accurate |
| Glowing eyes | Creepy, off-brand |
| Chrome/metallic | Too sci-fi |

---
