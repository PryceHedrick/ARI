# ARI Notification Strategy

> Comprehensive multi-channel notification system optimizing for signal-to-noise ratio, respecting attention, and ensuring critical items never get missed.

## Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Every notification should earn its interruption.

- **SMS** = "Drop everything" — reserved for true urgency
- **Notion** = "When you have a moment" — the async inbox
- **Silence** = Valid response for low-priority items

---

## Channels

### Channel 1: SMS (Text Message)
**Characteristics:**
- Immediate delivery
- Interrupts whatever you're doing
- Limited to ~160 characters
- No formatting, no links
- Can't be unseen

**Best for:**
- Time-sensitive emergencies
- Binary decisions needed NOW
- System failures
- Security alerts

**Never use for:**
- Status updates
- Summaries
- Progress reports
- Anything that can wait 1 hour

### Channel 2: Notion
**Characteristics:**
- Persistent, searchable
- Rich formatting, links, embeds
- Non-interruptive (unless Notion notifications on)
- Can be organized, tagged, filtered
- History preserved

**Best for:**
- Daily briefings
- Project updates
- Documentation
- Task lists
- Meeting notes
- Anything requiring context

## Priority Matrix

| Priority | Name | SMS | Notion | Response Time Expected | Examples |
|----------|------|-----|--------|------------------------|----------|
| **P0** | Critical | ✅ Immediate | ✅ Log | < 5 minutes | System down, security breach, data loss risk |
| **P1** | Urgent | ✅ Immediate | ✅ Log | < 1 hour | Build failed, payment failed, deadline today |
| **P2** | Important | ❌ No | ✅ Immediate | < 4 hours | Task completed, PR ready, meeting reminder |
| **P3** | Normal | ❌ No | ✅ Batched | < 24 hours | Progress update, weekly summary |
| **P4** | Low | ❌ No | ✅ Batched | When convenient | FYI, logs, metrics |

---

## Time-Based Rules

### Quiet Hours (10 PM - 7 AM)

| Priority | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| P0 | **Send SMS anyway** — true emergencies don't wait |
| P1 | **Queue for 7 AM** — urgent but not life-threatening |
| P2-P4 | **Queue for morning briefing** |

### Work Hours (8 AM - 6 PM)

| Priority | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| P0 | Immediate SMS + Notion |
| P1 | Immediate SMS + Notion |
| P2 | Notion only, included in evening summary |
| P3-P4 | Notion only, batched |

### Evening Hours (6 PM - 10 PM)

| Priority | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| P0 | Immediate SMS + Notion |
| P1 | **Delay 15 min** — allows batching, respects personal time |
| P2-P4 | Notion only |

---

## Anti-Spam Rules

### Deduplication
- Same error within 5 minutes → Single notification with count
- Same warning within 1 hour → Batch into one
- Repeated P1 for same issue → Escalate to P0 after 3rd occurrence

### Rate Limiting
- Max 5 SMS per hour (except P0)
- Max 20 SMS per day (except P0)
- P0 bypasses all limits

### Consolidation
- Multiple P2-P4 events → Batch into single Notion update every 30 min
- Evening: Consolidate all day's P3-P4 into summary
