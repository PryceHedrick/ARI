# /ari-think

Engage deep reasoning mode to solve complex problems in ARI.

## When to Use

- Architectural decisions with trade-offs
- Security vulnerabilities analysis
- Performance optimization strategies
- Multi-agent coordination issues
- Constitutional compliance questions

## Thinking Framework

### 1. Problem Definition
- What exactly is the problem?
- What are the constraints?
- What does success look like?

### 2. Context Gathering
- Relevant code and architecture
- Past decisions and their rationale
- ARI's invariants and ADRs

### 3. Option Generation
- Generate multiple solutions
- Consider unconventional approaches
- Think from different perspectives

### 4. Trade-off Analysis
| Option | Pros | Cons | Risk |
|--------|------|------|------|
| A | ... | ... | ... |
| B | ... | ... | ... |

### 5. Recommendation
- Recommended approach
- Implementation steps
- Validation criteria

## Example Usage

```
/ari-think How should we implement cross-agent memory sharing while maintaining trust boundaries?
```
