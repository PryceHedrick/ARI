# ARI Skill Generator

## Purpose

Automatically create new Claude Code skills when gaps are identified or new capabilities are needed.

## When to Use

- After identifying a missing skill
- When a pattern emerges that should be codified
- When new ARI features are added
- When external tools/APIs need integration

## Skill Generation Process

### Phase 1: Analysis
1. Identify the gap or need
2. Research existing patterns
3. Check for similar skills to extend
4. Define scope and boundaries

### Phase 2: Design
1. Define trigger conditions
2. Specify input requirements
3. Design output format
4. Consider edge cases

### Phase 3: Implementation
1. Create SKILL.md file
2. Write comprehensive documentation
3. Include code examples
4. Add ARI-specific context

### Phase 4: Validation
1. Test with real scenarios
2. Verify integration with existing skills
3. Check for conflicts
4. Update skill registry
