# ARI Knowledge Synthesizer

## Purpose

Transform session learnings, decisions, and discoveries into permanent, searchable knowledge that improves ARI's capabilities over time.

## Knowledge Categories

### 1. Patterns
Reusable solutions to common problems:
- Code patterns
- Architecture patterns
- Testing patterns
- Security patterns

### 2. Decisions
Architectural and design decisions:
- Why choices were made
- Alternatives considered
- Trade-offs accepted

### 3. Gotchas
Things that are easy to get wrong:
- Common mistakes
- Subtle bugs
- Edge cases

### 4. Fixes
Solutions to specific problems:
- Bug fixes
- Performance fixes
- Security fixes

### 5. Insights
Deeper understanding gained:
- How things work
- Why things are designed this way
- Connections between components

## Synthesis Process

### Phase 1: Extract
From the session, extract:
- Key decisions made
- Problems solved
- Patterns discovered
- Mistakes made and fixed

### Phase 2: Categorize
Assign each learning to:
- Category (pattern/decision/gotcha/fix/insight)
- Domain (kernel/system/agents/governance/ops/cli)
- Tags for searchability

### Phase 3: Formalize
Structure the knowledge:
```
Title: [Clear, searchable title]
Category: [Category]
Domain: [Domain]
Tags: [tag1, tag2, ...]
Context: [When this applies]
Content: [The actual knowledge]
Examples: [Code or usage examples]
Related: [Related knowledge items]
```

### Phase 4: Store
Persist to memory system:
- Use ari_memory_store via MCP
- Or update relevant skill files
- Or add to CLAUDE.md

### Phase 5: Index
Ensure findability:
- Add to relevant skill documentation
- Update knowledge index
- Cross-reference related items

## Storage Locations

| Knowledge Type | Storage Location |
|----------------|------------------|
| Patterns | Relevant skill SKILL.md |
| Decisions | docs/adr/ or CLAUDE.md |
| Gotchas | CONTRIBUTING.md or skill |
| Fixes | Related skill or memory |
| Insights | CLAUDE.md or architecture docs |

## Knowledge Quality Criteria

- [ ] Clear and concise title
- [ ] Searchable tags
- [ ] Specific, not generic
- [ ] Includes context for when it applies
- [ ] Has working examples
- [ ] Cross-referenced appropriately

## Output Format

```markdown
